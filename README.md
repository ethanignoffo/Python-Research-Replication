# Economics Research Replication Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and final report for replicating the findings of Burke et al. (2009) in their study *“Warming increases the risk of civil war incidence in Africa.”* The project uses data science methods to replicate the original study's results and provides an analysis of the findings.

The key components of this repository include:
- **MasterCode.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook with Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and replication.
- **Manuscript**: The final report detailing the methodology, replication process, and results.

## Project Structure
- **/code**: Contains the master code file used for the replication analysis.
  - **MasterCode.ipynb**: Python code for replicating the study’s findings.
- **/datasets**: Contains all the original datasets provided by the original study that were used in this replication. 
- **/manuscript**: Contains the final written report of the replication study.
  - **Replication_of_Burke_et_al_2009_Warming_and_Civil_War_in_Africa.pdf**: The PDF document with detailed results and analysis.

## Project Details
This project replicates Burke et al. (2009) *“Warming increases the risk of civil war incidence in Africa”* by using data science techniques to reproduce their analysis. The work involves:
- Importing and cleaning large datasets.
- Replicating the original statistical models used to study the correlation between temperature increases and the risk of civil conflict.
- Analyzing any discrepancies between our replication and the original findings.

## How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
2. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install necessary libraries, such as:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
     ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `MasterCode.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.
4. **Review Results**:
   - The output of the replication will be shown within the notebook. You can visualize the results and compare them to Burke et al.'s findings.
